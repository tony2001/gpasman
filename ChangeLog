----Gpasman 1.9.3----
- Selecting an entry automatically copies username to clipboard
- Activating (i.e., double-clicking) on an entry copies the password
  to the clipboard

  in the clipboard entry on the taskbar
- main window can now be arbitrarily resized by user, but same default
- comments column can now be deactivated under the "View" menu
- changed clipboard management:
  * GDK/Gtk clipboard interface used now, instead of GtkEditable facility

----Gpasman 1.3.0----
A complete rewrite

the file format is now in file.c, this file does not need gtk/glib, and can
be included in any other interface (cgi, ncurses) using file.h

the interface is in gpasman.c and is completely rewritten, and made more
intuitive. All the most requested features are implemented.

----Gpasman 1.2.0----
No changes, 1.1.3 was stable

----Gpasman 1.1.3----
An incredible stupid bug --> forgot to change the name of a #define, saving 
did not work in 1.1.2.

----Gpasman 1.1.2----
Fixed a symlink  in the src tree
Worked around a bug when the platform is big endian instead of little endian

gpasman-1.1.2 is still compatible with the gpasman-1.1.0 ~/.gpasman file 

----Gpasman 1.1.1----
the rc2 library is now static linked and distributed together with the 
gpasman sourcecode.  
str*'s are replaced by strn*'s
multiple copies of gpasman will not run anymore at the same time
(using $HOME/.gpasman.swp as lockfile)

gpasman-1.1.1 is compatible with the gpasman-1.1.0 ~/.gpasman file 

----Gpasman 1.1.0----
encryption is changed, it is *not* compatible with gpasman-1.0 encryption!
backup your passwords before updating gpasman!
David Rudder added PKCS 5 padding, and used the CBC mode for encryption
(now we only need the MD5 hash)
the user interface is changed, allowing sorting, and changing of entries
gtk-1.2 is now required
numbers changed to indicate this is an development version

----Gpasman 1.0----
added checks if the datafile is a regular file with the proper permissions
(-rw------). Otherwise exit the program. The user interface changed a little
bit, but no major changes. Some confirmation dialogs are added (clear all
entrie, exit without saving). 

----Gpasman 0.9----
the first version
