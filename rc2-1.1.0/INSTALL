Configuration:
Edit the Makefile.  Change anything that needs changing.  It's all
self-explanatory.

Compilation and installation is super-simple.  Just type one of the following:

make all - if you want the library and example compiled and installed
make librc2 - if you just want the library compiled
make i_librc2 - if you just want the library compiled and the library and
	include file installed
make rc2 - if you just want the example program compiled
make i_rc2 - if you just want the example program made and installed
